# Odin Recipes

This is an educational HTML project created as an assignment from The Odin's Project Foundations Course.

The project is comprised of four HTML pages: a homepage and three recipe pages.

In this projected I used HTML to build a web-page's structure. I also practice writing good and informative commit messages.
